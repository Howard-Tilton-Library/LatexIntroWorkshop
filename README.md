# Description
Latex is a markup language, like HTML, that gives you a way to type up
mathematical documents that looks clean and professional.

It is widely used in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) disciplines to produce documents that include
mathematical notation, like publications, theses, and books.

However, it can also be used type up homework assignments or produce
organized lecture notes. It allows you to easily save and edit your
"source code", which you can then easily use to generate PDFs or even
web pages.

Latex is also widely used across academia, so this is a particularly
good tool to know for those who are considering graduate school.
However, it is also gaining popularity elsewhere - for example, it's
possible to use Latex to produce resumes, reports, or presentations.

This workshop will cover how to set up a Latex environment, how to
produce most of the mathematical symbols seen in undergraduate
courses, and how generate a completed PDF document.

Please bring a laptop to follow along!
