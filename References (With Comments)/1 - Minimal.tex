% Comments are denoted with the percent symbol

% Almost everything that isn't content in LaTex is a command,
% and almost every command has the same format:
% \someCommandName[someOptions]{Some Content, or an argument}

% You only really need three lines to produce a basic document:
% The document class, and the begin/end document lines
\documentclass{article}

% Everything between \documentclass and \begin is the "preamble"

% We'll see the preamble used more later, but generally speaking this is where you can take care
% of setting up the document before you start actually writing content. This may involve importing 
% packages that give you certain functionality or styling, setting up variables like the author's name
% or the current date, or writing/including your own custom functions.

\begin{document}

% Your content goes here - you need at least one character for it to compile!
A

\end{document}
% Nothing should come after this, it really is the end of your document
