% The Sharelatex default document pre-populates a number of things for you, giving you a document that is guarantee to compile. The template utilizes a few more features than the minimal document, though.

% The "article" class is one of the most versatile classes, so it's a good default to go with. 
% (But there are many others!)
\documentclass{article}

% This just ensures unicode support - not strictly necessary, but useful if you're working with non-English languages
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% These commands set up variables that will be used later in the document.
\title{Skeleton Code}
\author{Your name here }
\date{Enter date}

% The document content starts here
\begin{document}

% This command uses the variables we set up earlier to render a nicely formatted title
\maketitle

% Document classes give you various commands for communicating the structure of your document - the article class happens to use "sections"
\section{Introduction}

Document content goes here.

\end{document}
